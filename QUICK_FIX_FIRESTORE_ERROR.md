# Quick Fix: "Failed to Load Data from Firestore"

## The Problem
You're seeing "failed to load data" errors because Firestore security rules are blocking access.

## The Solution (5 Minutes)

### Option 1: Use Test Mode Rules (Quickest - For Testing Only)

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select project: **flex-mind-fit**
3. Click **Firestore Database** → **Rules** tab
4. Replace everything with this:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

5. Click **Publish**
6. Wait 30 seconds
7. Restart your app

### Option 2: Use Secure Rules (Recommended)

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select project: **flex-mind-fit**
3. Click **Firestore Database** → **Rules** tab
4. Replace everything with this:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    function isAuthenticated() {
      return request.auth != null;
    }
    
    function isOwner(userId) {
      return isAuthenticated() && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, create, update, delete: if isOwner(userId);
    }
    
    // Temporary development access
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.time < timestamp.date(2025, 12, 31);
    }
  }
}
```

5. Click **Publish**
6. Wait 30 seconds
7. Restart your app

## Verify It's Working

### Check Console Logs
When you run your app, you should see:
```
✓ Firebase initialized successfully
✓ User document found in Firestore
✓ User data loaded successfully
```

### Check Firebase Console
1. Go to **Firestore Database** → **Data** tab
2. You should see a `users` collection
3. Click on a document to see user data

## If Still Not Working

### Check Firestore is Enabled
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Click **Firestore Database**
3. If you see "Get started", click it
4. Choose "Start in test mode"
5. Select a location (us-central recommended)
6. Wait for initialization

### Sign Out and Back In
1. Open your app
2. Sign out
3. Sign back in
4. Check console logs

### Check Your Internet
1. Make sure you have internet connection
2. Try accessing https://console.firebase.google.com/ in browser
3. If you can't access, it's a network issue

## Need More Help?

Run the Firebase Test Page:
1. In your app → Settings → Firebase Connection Test
2. Try each test button
3. Read the error messages
4. Share the error code with me

## What Changed in Code

✅ Better error messages in console
✅ Automatic detection of permission-denied errors
✅ Automatic creation of default user data
✅ Detailed logging of each step

The main issue was missing Firestore security rules. Update the rules in Firebase Console and you should be good to go!
