# Complete Progress Tracking System

## Overview
A comprehensive Firebase-based progress tracking system that automatically records workouts, calculates calories, tracks streaks, and displays real-time progress.

## What Was Created

### 1. New Models
**File: `lib/models/workout_session.dart`**
- Tracks individual workout sessions with:
  - Workout type and name
  - Duration in seconds
  - Calories burned (calculated)
  - Timestamp and date
  - User ID for Firebase queries

### 2. Workout Tracking Service

#### Calorie Calculation:
```dart
- Strength Training: 8 cal/minute
- Cardio Workouts: 10 cal/minute
- Home Workouts: 7 cal/minute
- Yoga Exercises: 3 cal/minute
```

### 3. Updated Workout Timer
**File: `lib/screens/workout_timer_page.dart`**
- Automatically saves workout when completed
- Records to Firebase `workout_sessions` collection
- Updates user's total stats
- Updates streak counter

### 4. Real-Time Progress Tracker
**File: `lib/screens/progress_tracker_page.dart`**

#### What's Tracked:
1. **Weekly Workouts Chart** - Line graph showing workout calories per day
2. **Calories Burned Chart** - Bar graph of daily calories
3. **Summary Stats**:
   - Total Workouts Completed
   - Total Calories Burned
   - Current Streak (consecutive days)
   - Total Recent Workouts

#### Features:
- Pull-to-refresh to reload data
- Real-time data from Firebase

### 5. Updated Home Page
**File: `lib/screens/home_page.dart`**

- Automatically refreshes after workouts

## Firebase Data Structure

### User Document (`users` collection)
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "name": "User Name",
  "workoutsCompleted": 10,
  "caloriesBurned": 850,
  "currentStreak": 5,
  "bestStreak": 12,
  "lastWorkoutDate": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Workout Sessions (`workout_sessions` collection)
```json
{
  "id": "1705324800000",
  "userId": "user-id-123",
  "workoutName": "Strength Training",
  "workoutId": "strength_training",
  "duration": 1200,
  "caloriesBurned": 160,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "date": "2024-01-15T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## How It Works

### When User Completes Workout:

1. **Timer finishes** all exercises
2. **Workout is recorded** to `workout_sessions`
3. **User stats updated**:
   - `workoutsCompleted` +1
   - `caloriesBurned` + calculated calories
4. **Streak updated**:
   - Checks if last workout was yesterday
   - Increases streak if continuous
   - Tracks best streak ever
5. **UI updates** automatically on next refresh

### Streak Logic:

```dart
- If last workout was yesterday â†’ streak +1
- If last workout was today â†’ streak stays same
- If last workout was > 1 day ago â†’ reset to 1
- Always tracks best streak achieved
```

## User Experience
